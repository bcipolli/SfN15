# SfN15 iPython notebooks

Blogging for PLOS, doing my thing; when I can get cool data to play with, something comes here.

***`HH2015.ipynb`*** - Notebook looking at how sleep relates to brain structure over 24 species.
* Neural density (D) in cortex controls the amount of metabolites produced during waking
* Surface area (A) of cortex controls how well metabolites are washed away during waking
* Therefore D/A controls how long you can keep awake before having to sleep.
