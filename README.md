# iPython notebooks for blog posts.

Sometimes, something happens that requires a deeper look. Here's where I post my quick & dirty iPython notebooks for making sense of what people say, using data I have access to.

Current directory structure:

* `2015-12-31-herculano-houzel-sleep` - for Herculano-Houzel (2015) paper on sleep, brain size, and species differences.
* `2015-12-01-gender-brain-differences` - for Joel et al. (2015) paper on "lack of gender differences". I doubt their logic.
